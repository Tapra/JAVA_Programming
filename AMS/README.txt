This is the README for the AMS assignment 2.

The main method is located in ams.test.AMSMain

Instructions

when the system initializes the program entry dialog appears and 
can not be dismissed until a valid program is entered.


TOOLBAR:
What the Toolbar buttons do:

Add course: will add a course to the program.
Remove course: will remove the course selected in the 
               drop-down menu.
Add test courses: will add test courses to the program. It is 
                  used to help with debugging.
Reset Program: will reset the program with the old 
               student. (Student functionality to come later)
Sorting order: this drop-down menu will determine the sorting order.

These buttons are available on the menu bar as well, except sorting order.

ADD COURSE:
The main issue I had with this was that only 1 prerequisite course can be added.

Everything else works as intended.... I hope ;)

Enjoy using my Program
